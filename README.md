# Legacy License Monitoring

This repository offers a way for webMethods users to continuously monitor their installation landscape with the purpose of checking the correct licenses utilization.
These tools are intended to be executed with versions prior to webMethods 11, that are not covered already by other means.

`Inspectors` are CLI applications that inspect the relevant parameters on every node hosting webMethods processes. Reporters are CLI applications that gather the information from the inspectors, centralize, interpret and produce aggregated reports.
